## 2026-09-14 — Autonomous cycle 1

User authorized continuous independent progress until stop or acceptance review.
Prioritize a measured V0 before adding V1. Preserve original scaffold semantics.

Decisions:

- Implement a scalar inherited random-movement probability instead of a neural
  controller; the latter belongs to V1. Do not write food-seeking behavior.
- Use integer energy and an explicit external regrowth supply to allow exact
  accounting and meaningful invariants at every tick.
- Keep new dynamics under `bitgenesis.v0` and `v0-darwin-1`; keep empty-world
  commands and definitions unchanged.
- Record provenance, raw lifecycle events, metrics, lineage and replay artifacts.
- Test matched initial seeds with and without mutation before asserting adaptation.

Validation so far: 13 unit/integration tests pass, including deterministic replay,
energy accounting across five seeds, inheritance, mutation, newborn scheduling,
torus boundaries, extinction without resources, and output preservation.

Campaign 001 completed: ten 5,000-tick runs, no extinction; all converged to one
founder lineage. Mutation and no-mutation treatments both concentrated near high
movement probabilities. See `campaign-001.md`; do not interpret mutation as
necessary for this initial selection. Replay controls and terminal values checked
in a browser. Next: the preregistered fixed-trait/cost assay (campaign 002).

## 2026-09-14 — Autonomous cycle 2

Campaign 002 completed: 100 runs / 200,000 ticks, no invariant failures. Fixed
trait 250 supported larger populations than 1000 under both costs; expensive
movement at trait 1000 caused extinction in 8/10 seeds. Report all outcomes in
`campaign-002.md`. Do not confuse demographic productivity with individual
reproductive success. Next causal question: direct trait competition.

Added standalone lineage inspection: ID lookup, ancestry navigation, direct
children and founder outcomes. Browser check: individual 1640 -> parent 1618,
founder 24, generation 23; parent showed children 1624, 1631, 1640. New replay
at `data/acceptance-v0/` uses clean commit `27b2137` and records 1,000 ticks.

V0 minimal graduation conditions now have bounded evidence; see `ACCEPTANCE.md`.
Keep exploring V0 mechanisms and hardening reproducibility before adding V1.
