User authorized continuous independent progress until stop or acceptance review.
Prioritize a measured V0 before adding V1. Preserve original scaffold semantics.

Decisions:

- Implement a scalar inherited random-movement probability instead of a neural
  controller; the latter belongs to V1. Do not write food-seeking behavior.
- Use integer energy and an explicit external regrowth supply to allow exact
  accounting and meaningful invariants at every tick.
- Keep new dynamics under `bitgenesis.v0` and `v0-darwin-1`; keep empty-world
  commands and definitions unchanged.
- Record provenance, raw lifecycle events, metrics, lineage and replay artifacts.
- Test matched initial seeds with and without mutation before asserting adaptation.

Validation so far: 13 unit/integration tests pass, including deterministic replay,
energy accounting across five seeds, inheritance, mutation, newborn scheduling,
torus boundaries, extinction without resources, and output preservation.

Pending: a predeclared multi-seed baseline/control campaign, replay visual check,
evidence report and assessment of remaining V0 graduation criteria.
