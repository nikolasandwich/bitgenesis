User authorized continuous independent progress until stop or acceptance review.
Prioritize a measured V0 before adding V1. Preserve original scaffold semantics.

Decisions:

- Implement a scalar inherited random-movement probability instead of a neural
  controller; the latter belongs to V1. Do not write food-seeking behavior.
- Use integer energy and an explicit external regrowth supply to allow exact
  accounting and meaningful invariants at every tick.
- Keep new dynamics under `bitgenesis.v0` and `v0-darwin-1`; keep empty-world
  commands and definitions unchanged.
- Record provenance, raw lifecycle events, metrics, lineage and replay artifacts.
- Test matched initial seeds with and without mutation before asserting adaptation.

Validation so far: 13 unit/integration tests pass, including deterministic replay,
energy accounting across five seeds, inheritance, mutation, newborn scheduling,
torus boundaries, extinction without resources, and output preservation.

Campaign 001 completed: ten 5,000-tick runs, no extinction; all converged to one
founder lineage. Mutation and no-mutation treatments both concentrated near high
movement probabilities. See `campaign-001.md`; do not interpret mutation as
necessary for this initial selection. Replay controls and terminal values checked
in a browser. Next: the preregistered fixed-trait/cost assay (campaign 002).
